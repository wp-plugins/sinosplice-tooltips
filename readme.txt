Sinosplice Tooltips was conceived by John Pasden as a WordPress plugin
replacement for the custom CSS and JavaScript code he had been using
for years on Sinosplice.com.  It was originally designed to provide
pinyin readings for Chinese characters, but is flexible enough to be
adapted to a variety of uses.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `SinospliceTooltips` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. If needed, edit the Sinosplice Tooltips options in your Administration Panel.
